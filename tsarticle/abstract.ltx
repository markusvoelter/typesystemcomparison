With today's tools and frameworks, building domain specific languages (DSLs) has
become increasingly popular and constructing languages for complex domains has
become viable. However, complex DSLs may require advanced checking capabilities, as they
usually include expressions and types. Type system frameworks offer reusable
checking facilities for DSLs and may dramatically reduce the effort for writing constraints. This
article compares different type system frameworks for Xtext 2, a popular
Eclipse-based DSL framework.
