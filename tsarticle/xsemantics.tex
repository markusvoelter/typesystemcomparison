\section{Xsemantics}
\label{sec:xsemantics}

Lorenzo Bettini's type system Xsemantics, formerly called XtypeS~\cite{Bet11},
uses an Xtext metamodel and a set of rules and premises as input and returns a set of generated Java methods that can be used in Xtext's scoping and validator classes.
\subsection{Type System Specification}
Xsemantics offers a declarative specification of type rules by using
Judgements
rules declaratively specify statements that must hold for the type system, example

checking rules

axioms

predefined operations

\subsection{Usage in Xtext}

With the declarative specification (written in the Xsemantics DSL), Java methods are generated that can be used in the SopeProvider or Validators. 

If the declarative rules are marked with [â€¦], Xtext validator classes are directly created and no further work is necessary.

Example output for reusable methods

\begin{lstlisting}
TypeSystemResult<MyOtherGrammarElement> typeAsMyOtherGrammarElement(MyGrammarElement left); 
TypeSystemResult<MyGrammarElement, MyOtherGrammarElement> type(MyGrammarElement left, MyOtherGrammarElement right); 
TypeSystemResult<Boolean> checkType(MyGrammarElement left, MyOtherGrammarElement right); 
\end{lstlisting}
