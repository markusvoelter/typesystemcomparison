\section{Xtext Type System}

Markus VÃ¶lter's type system allows declarative and procedural type constraint specification. It features a Java class called DefaultTypesystem which implements Itypesystem and provides methods that can be used in the declarative specification of the developer's type system rules. In the future, a DSL may be created for the declarative type specification. A DSL for the API is also provided.
